Tiny Zombies is a project developed using Unity. It is about surviving a horde of attacking zombies as long as possible while you are trapped inside a park.
The only weapon you have with you to take down zombies: a revolver.

## How to play

In order to play it you can just download the project and open it on Unity (dev version 2020.3) and hit the button play in the Editor.<br>
Or you can also play it on my [itch.io wepage](https://sagzain.itch.io/tiny-zombies)<br>

While on the Main Menu, press Start to play a new game.<br>
The player movement is controlled by using the ASDW keys from the keyboard.<br>
The mouse will rotate the player and aims wherever is pointing on the screen.<br>
And by using Left Click we will shoot in the desired direction.<br>

The user interface shows us the amount of damage we can receive before game is over (health points left), the score we have achieved along the game and the bullets we have left in the weapon untill we have to reload.
